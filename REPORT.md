Issues:
None noted. The code appears to be working as intended and as requested in specs. 

Notes:
I worked with professor Besser for this assignment. Afterwards, I reviewed each header file to ensure competency. 
For currency, I took the  numbers as is, I did not convert the currency to a base currency. 
This code throws 2 exceptions. 
1. If the country is not declared in the enum. 
2. If cent value is less than zero or over 99, or if the dollar amount entered is less than 0. 
All values entered are assumed to be in US dollars. This code has a lot of comments to help me remember what I did and why I did it. 
For this assignment, I worked with Colin R. and Drew D., but mostly with professor Besser.
